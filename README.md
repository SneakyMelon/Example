# Example

[![Software License][ico-license]](LICENSE.md)

This is an Example blog style website in an attempt to relearn many elements of web development. This blog
aims to provide working examples of database interactions, show case logic, PSR knowledge and much more.

Example does not follow the MVC logic control such as many other frameworks. This has been a deliberate attempt
to learn how to develop without using larger projects to copy and paste from.
